Improvements to the platform/conductor for 0.5.6:

[ ] Reset-GPU working for two-in-one slot (egl-dri)
[ ] Extend Conductor with a thread monitor for resize-ack
[ ] Add Affinity tracking (GPU- presence) to vstore
[ ] Allow a priority-load for processing to let a specific
    client delay composition and synch to hit the 'falling'
		edge.
